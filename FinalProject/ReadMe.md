#### ENSF 611 - W2023 - Final Project

## Predicting The Winner of a Soccer Match Using Machine Learning

This project is based off the following repository:
https://github.com/tunghoangt/Soccer-prediction-with-Machine-Learning 

In that project, the authors created a dataset of the English Premier League by scraping data from the web. They then used machine learning to predict the winner of a match. In this project, we will use the same dataset and try to predict the winner of a match using machine learning. We will also try to predict the score of a match.

Furthermore, the authors were successful in predicting the winner of the 2018 English Premier League season. In this project, we're just going to use their data and try to see which is the best model to predict an outcome of a match based on some features. 

While in the repository, we can see that the authors used a lot of different techniques, the parameters, cross-validation, and gridsearch is based on what I've learned in ENSF 611 so the scope is much more limited than the extent of the original project.
